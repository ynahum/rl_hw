------Part 2 - Preliminary: Mountain Car Problem and Feature Engineering:------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"PreliminarySolution.py" - run main for-
-> Question 2.2 (Ploting of Descrete state space feature)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------Part 3 - LSPI:----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "lspi.py" - run main for-
 -> Question 3.5 ( per seed the lspi iterations loop collects the new updated w coeficients 
    and evaluates it over the 50 random stating states by playing a game from these starting states
	Also there is a flag to enable the plot called plot_flag. defaults to False)
 -> Question 3.6 (for different amount of samples collected need to uncomment the list
	of samples_to_collect_list used  (samples_to_collect_list = [10000, 100000, 150000]). the default is [100000] samples.
	In the for loop of the amount of samples used, the evaluation is done on the last w caluclated by lspi.
	The same flag for plot enablement (plot_flag) is used for success rate vs samples amount)
