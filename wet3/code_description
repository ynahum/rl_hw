"PreliminarySolution.py" - run main for-
-> Question 2.2 (Ploting of Descrete state space feature)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------Part 3 - LSPI:----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 "lspi.py" - run main for-
 -> Question 3.5 ( for different seeds run, one needs to uncomment the list
	of seeds used  (seeds = [123, 234, 345]). the default is only seed [345]. 
	In the for loop of seeds per seed the lspi iterations loop collects
	the new updated w coeficients and evaluate it over the 50 random stating states by playing a game from it
	The plotting blocks for a user reaction on the last seed in list.
	Also there is a flag to enable the plot called plot_avg_performance. defaults to True)
 -> Question 3.6 (for different amount of samples collected need to uncomment the list
	of samples_to_collect_list used  (samples_to_collect_list = [10000, 100000, 150000]). the default is on [100000] samples.
	In the for loop of the amount of samples used, the evaluation is done on the last w caluclated by lspi.
	The plotting blocks for a user reaction on the last itertaion over the samples_to_collect_list list.
	Also there is a flag to enable the plot called plot_success_rate_vs_amount_of_samples. defaults to True)

 "QLearningSolution.py" - run main for-
 -> Question 4.2 (Evaluation Criteria - Measure Performance before training) implemented by method "PerformanceOfGreedyPolicy".
 -> Question 4.3 (Solving Mountain Car Problem by Online Q-Learning for different seeds) implemented with method "Qlearning". 
    + Added implementation for method "update_theta" in "q_learn_mountain_car.py".
